The technique used for the Trippy Parrot project was pixel minpulation. For this project I didn't want to improve the project with each new version, rather have equally as good work but just different. I set myself some rules for this project, like; the parrot has to be visiblly clear, each version had to have the "Trippy" theme but have different ways of getting there. My show piece is version 4, this is because I love the way this version starts of pretty modest but just continues to get worse as it continues to run. The important thing for me was to come up with 4 different ways of very trippy experiences but keeping the same fundimentals, the experimentation of changing speeds and colour cycles was key for this project. I found it very fun playing around with loops and seeing how a small change in code can change the way the pixels interact and form different patterns.
