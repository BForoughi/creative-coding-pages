The technique used for this project was user input, specifically mouse inputs, going through the iterations you can see that I have developed how the user can interact with the program. Starting with creating a pen program where the user can draw whatever they wish to, and slowly turining it into a weird blob art piece. I achieved this by tracking where the user's mouse was and then outputted an ellipse on wherever the updated postion of the mouse was. Using the HSB colour wheel to cycle for every blob allows for a "trippy" effect to be created. The main thing I like about it is that there is so many possible outcomes to what can be made due to the freedom of being to control how the ellipse moves on the X and Y axis. My show piece has to be the last iteration, I think the "lazy" effect adds another layor of detail, and be it subtle I think the slight lack of control the effect gives allows for more random and interesting outcomes.
