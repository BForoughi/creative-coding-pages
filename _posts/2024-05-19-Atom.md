# Atom Project

The technique used for this project was 3D geometrics and the use of directional light and orbital control. Going through the versions of the Atom project you can see how I experimented and improved apon using rotation with 3D shapes. The hardest part about this project was being able get the particals to orbit around the nucleous due to their pathway way, this was a very important to get right for me, as I wanted to make it as realistic as possible. Adding the obit control allows the user to rotate the atom and see it from different angles, I like this because it improves the overall experience. For me it feels like I am in a science museum viewing a hollogram of an atom and being able to interact with the exhibit is a subtle touch with a big impact. With regards to the directional light, I was simpily experimenting with it and thought it would be a good feature for the atom project. It gives no real impact to the atom, in fact it makes it less realistic, but I realised when experimenting with different light for the atom having the directional light adds to the experience of the project.
